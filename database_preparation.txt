Manipulations performed in order to create a database design for Superstore Project:

1. I have changed Order date and Ship date to be YYYY/MM/DD (can be ordered easily even when seen as a string).
2. I have rounded the Profit and Sales values to the 2nd decimal
3. Created ProductPrice and SupplierPrice based on the formulas: 
   * ProductPrice=(Sales/Quantity)/(1-Discount) 
   * SupplierPrice=(Sales-Profit)/Quantity
4. I have turned ProductPrice and SupplierPrice into cents
5. The name of the columns were changed to the standardized sqlite(example:CustomerName)
6. I have changed the column name Segment to CustomerType, just for user-friendly reasons
7. I have created two new unique value Columns AddressID and SalesID
8. I have corrected the ProducID so there are no duplicates (there were around 50 duplicates,
 same ProductID but different ProductName and ProductPrice)
9. Final Tables = ['Customers', 'Address', 'Products', 'Shipment', 'OrderDetails']4
10. The attached PNG file is a visual presentation of the Database Design
